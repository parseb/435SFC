# 435: Stake for Change


An ETH staking platform whereby users, that is, US users, can stake ether and make the yield available for withdrawal by any of the 435 offices. Whereby, the amount they can permissionlessly withdraw is immutably determined by the aggregated, balance proportional, preferences of the stakers. It's donating via a vehicle that the SEC is being stupid about and political preference aggregation at the same time.

<br>
tldr; stake ethereum, offices/campaigns withdraw % yield determined by staker stated redistributive preference and their relative weight. <br>

<br>

<b>Needed</b>:
* protocol (stripped walllaw variation should do)
* account abstraction - CB wallet as a service

<b>Unknowns</b>:
* law likely stipulates that only US citizens can donate.<br> Q: Does coinbase have any kind of on-chain US-KYC mechanisms such as `CB.isUS(msg.sender)->(true/false)`
