# 456SFC
435 Stake for Change

____

If I were an American, what I would do is create an ETH staking platform whereby users, that is, US users, can stake ether and make the yield available for withdrawal by any of the 435 offices. Whereby, the amount they can permissionlessly withdraw is immutably determined by the aggregated, balance proportional, preferences of the stakers.
<br><br>
tldr; - holders stake ethereum, offices/campaigns withdraw % yield that is determined by staker stated allocation preference and their ammounts.

<br><br>

Needed:
* protocol (stripped walllaw variation should do)
* account abstraction - CB wallet as a service

Unknowns:
* law likely stipulates that only US citizens can donate.<br> Q: Does coinbase have any kind of on-chain US-KYC mechanisms such as `CB.isUS(msg.sender)->(true/false)`
